Let's explore the possibilities for each:\n\n- For the basketball, we might consider smaller items such as a marble, grape, or ping pong ball.\n- For the sand cat, we might consider animals with much larger ears, such as an African elephant or fennec fox.\n\nTo achieve the opposite outcome (True), I'll focus on changing the animal to one with ears large enough to accommodate a basketball.
